system, usual Japanese high tech toilets, powerful air-con system, comfortable beds.I have nothing to fault this hotel on.The location was excellent for getting around, the French Kitchen on the 2nd floor did a great competitive breakfast, service was spot on, and the gym and pool facilities on the 5th floor were very well ordered and surprisingly little used on the occasions I visited them.I
